```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = F}
library(magrittr)
library(realtime)

## plot with a theme_grey() feel
## also has a floating rectangle to 
## demonstrate that the sketch is 
## chained correctly
realtime(w = 600, h = 500) %>%
    theme_grey() %>%
    fill("#000000") %>%
    rect(100, 100, 100, 100) 

## a theme_bw option
realtime(w = 600, h = 500) %>%
    theme_bw() %>%
    fill("#000000") %>%
    rect(100, 100, 100, 100)

## link to a stream coming from a websocket
realtime(w = 600, h = 500) %>%
    theme_grey() %>%
    add_data_stream('ws://localhost:9454/') ## this would be neater if it was the *first* part of the chain

## for example, create a websocket of random data
library(httpuv)
library(jsonlite)

app <- list(
  call = function(req) {
    stop("call is not implemented. Something is wrong if you see this")
  },
  onWSOpen = function(ws) {
    id = 1
    while(TRUE){
      x = rnorm(1, 150, 50)
      # print(x)
      ws$send(toJSON(list(x = x)))
      Sys.sleep(0.02)
      id = id+1
    }
  }
)

## and run the server
runServer("0.0.0.0", 9454, app, 250)

```

TODO:

- gridlines should be part of backgroud; at the moment data sits *under* them
- viewport needs to shift with data
- scales need to shift with data
- connect to an arbitrary source
